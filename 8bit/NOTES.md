parts in 400x400 pixel format for two types (female / male);
"true" pixel size is 20x20 - that is, 20x20 pixels for one "true" pixel (20x20 = 400)


the five parts (minus the background) include:

- face
- hair (m) / head (f)
- eye
- mouth
- clothes


note: rename female head part to hair part (to "normalize")
and keep male / female parts in sync - the same.










## Todos, Ideas


- add a report to pixelate to report an all part images that
  CANNOT get pixelated with a 50% threshold (report how many pixels below 50% threshold, etc.) and report on all part images that yes, CAN get pixelated
  with the "simple" 50% threshold formula

- rename eye to eyes - why? why not?
